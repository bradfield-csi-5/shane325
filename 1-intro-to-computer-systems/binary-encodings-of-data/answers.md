### Binary Representations of Data

Here are my answers to some of the prework for this class.

#### 1.1 Simple converion
- `0x9`
- `0x88`
- `0xf7`

### 1.2 CSS colors
- Our answer is a power of two.
- Each of our 3 bytes can represent 8 bits each to give a total of 24 bits.
- 2^24 is 16,777,216.

### 1.3 Say hello to hellohex
- We would expect 34 hexadecimal characters (17 bytes x 2).

The first 5 bytes converted to binary are:
- `0b01101000`
- `0b01100101`
- `0b01101100`
- `0b01101100`
- `0b01101111`

### 2.1 Integers basic conversion
- `0b100`
- `0b1000001`
- `0b1101001`
- `0b11111111`

- `2`
- `3`
- `108`
- `85`

### 2.2 Unsigned binary addition
11111111
00001101
00001100 (12)

- We have demonstrated integer overflow.

### 2.3 Two's complement conversion
- `0b01111111`
- `0b10000000`
- `0b11111111`
- `0b00000001`
- `0b11110010`

- `-125`
- `-60`

### 2.4 Addition of two's complement signed integers
01111111 (127)
10000000 (-128)
11111111 (-1)
